      1. Identify Key Support and Resistance Levels
      - *Support Level*: A price level where a downtrend can be expected to pause due to a concentration of demand.
      - *Resistance Level*: A price level where an uptrend can be expected to pause due to a concentration of supply.
      - *Tools*: Use historical price data, trendlines, and moving averages to identify key support and resistance levels.

      2. Wait for Price to Approach Key Levels
      - *Confirmation Signal*: When the price nears the identified support or resistance level, observe market behavior and volume changes.
      - *Volume Observation*: A breakout with significant volume is considered more reliable.

      3. Enter the Trade
      - *Buy Breakout*: Execute a buy order when the price breaks above the resistance level.
      - *Sell Breakout*: Execute a sell order when the price breaks below the support level.
      - *Order Type*: Use market orders to ensure quick entry during a breakout, or limit orders to set a specific entry price after the breakout.

      4. Set Stop-Loss and Take-Profit Levels
      - *Stop-Loss*: Protect capital in case of a failed breakout. Typically set just below the breakout level (for a buy) or just above (for a sell).
      - *Take-Profit*: Lock in profits when the price reaches a predetermined target. Targets can be based on historical price levels, technical indicators (e.g., Fibonacci extensions), or a fixed risk-reward ratio (e.g., 1:2 or 1:3).

      5. Monitor and Manage the Trade
      - *Continuous Monitoring*: Keep an eye on price movements, especially as they near the stop-loss or take-profit levels.
      - *Dynamic Adjustments*: Adjust stop-loss and take-profit levels based on market conditions to lock in more profits when favorable.
    strategy_attention_points:
      - Analyze K-line patterns to determine support and resistance levels
      - BOLL can be used to confirm support and resistance levels
      - VR3 can be used to confirm a breakout
      - Enter after a breakout.
      - If a false breakout occurs, enter the market in the opposite direction.
      - If the stop loss price of a short position needs to be greater than the closing price, the take profit price should be less than the closing price
