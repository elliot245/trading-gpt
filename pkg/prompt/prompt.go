üí° Memory has plenty of space - you can add new insights and experiences to expand your knowledge base.
{{else if .MemoryUsagePercent | lt 80}}
‚ö†Ô∏è Memory is getting full - focus on adding only the most important new insights while keeping content concise.
{{else if .MemoryUsagePercent | lt 95}}
üö® Memory is nearly full - prioritize consolidating and summarizing existing knowledge rather than adding new content.
{{else}}
üî• Memory is at critical capacity - you MUST consolidate, summarize, and remove less critical information to make room for essential new insights.

IMPORTANT: The strategy runs in cycles, and your memory resets at the beginning of each cycle. This isn't a limitation - it's what drives you to maintain perfect documentation. After each reset, you rely ENTIRELY on your Memory Part to understand the project and continue work effectively. Each cycle, you must output complete memory within the word limit to maintain continuity.
