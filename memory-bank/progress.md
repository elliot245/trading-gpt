# Progress: Trading-AI

## Current Status
The Trading-AI project is a functional trading system with LLM integration that allows users to express trading strategies in natural language. The Memory Bank documentation has been established to maintain comprehensive project knowledge. Currently, significant progress has been made on the technical specification document, with the conceptual design section now complete and featuring a simplified system architecture.

## What Works
- Integration with bbgo trading engine
- Multiple LLM provider support (OpenAI, Google AI, Claude AI, Ollama)
- Natural language strategy interpretation
- Basic trading functionality with risk management (stop loss, take profit)
- Chat interface for strategy interaction
- Notification system for trading updates
- Agent system with trading and keeper agents
- Event-driven architecture for market data processing and decision making

## What's Left to Build/Improve
- Enhanced error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Expanded test coverage across all components
- Performance optimizations for faster strategy execution
- Additional technical indicators and strategy components
- Improved natural language understanding for complex strategies
- Extended documentation and examples
- Enhanced visualization of trading results

## Known Issues
- LLM context limitations may impact complex strategy descriptions
- Interpretation quality varies between different LLM providers
- Exchange-specific features may require additional implementation
- Rate limiting on external APIs can impact system performance

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Initial Concept**: A simple trading bot with LLM integration
- **Current Direction**: A comprehensive trading platform with natural language interface
- **Future Vision**: An intelligent trading assistant capable of strategy suggestion and optimization

## Milestones Achieved
- Successful integration of bbgo trading engine
- Implementation of multiple LLM providers
- Creation of agent-based architecture
- Development of environment abstractions for external systems
- Implementation of risk management features
- Establishment of Memory Bank documentation system
