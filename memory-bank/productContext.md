# Product Context: Trading-AI

## Problem Statement
Traditional algorithmic trading requires significant technical expertise in both trading concepts and programming. This creates a high barrier to entry for many traders who understand markets but lack the technical skills to implement automated strategies.

## Solution
Trading-AI bridges this gap by allowing users to express trading strategies in natural language. The system then:
1. Interprets the natural language description
2. Converts it into executable trading logic
3. Implements proper risk management (take profit, stop loss)
4. Provides feedback and monitoring

## Target Users
- Traders with market knowledge but limited programming skills
- Algorithmic traders looking for faster strategy prototyping
- Quantitative analysts exploring strategy ideas
- Retail investors interested in automated trading

## User Journey
1. **Setup**: User configures exchange API credentials and LLM access
2. **Strategy Creation**: User describes their trading strategy in natural language
3. **Refinement**: System may ask clarifying questions to ensure understanding
4. **Execution**: Strategy is translated to code and begins execution
5. **Monitoring**: User can chat with the strategy to understand performance and make adjustments

## Value Proposition
- **Accessibility**: Enables algorithmic trading without coding skills
- **Speed**: Rapid prototyping and testing of trading ideas
- **Flexibility**: Support for various technical indicators and trading approaches
- **Safety**: Built-in risk management with stop loss and take profit features

## User Experience Goals
- **Intuitive**: Natural language interface that understands trading terminology
- **Transparent**: Clear feedback about how natural language is interpreted
- **Safe**: Protection against unintended or risky trading behavior
- **Informative**: Detailed updates on strategy performance

## Limitations
- Natural language interpretation may sometimes require clarification
- Complex multi-part strategies may need to be broken down
- Strategy performance is dependent on market conditions (as with any trading system)
- LLM capabilities vary based on the chosen provider
