# Active Context: Trading-AI

## Current Focus
The current focus is on establishing the Memory Bank documentation system for the Trading-AI project. This will provide a comprehensive reference for all aspects of the project, ensuring consistent understanding and efficient development.

## Recent Changes
- Created initial Memory Bank structure with core documentation files
- Established documentation hierarchy and relationships between files
- Documented primary system architecture and design patterns

## Next Steps
1. Complete Memory Bank setup with all required files
2. Review existing implementation against documented patterns
3. Identify any gaps in documentation or implementation
4. Prioritize development tasks based on documentation insights

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **Documentation Approach**: Using structured Markdown files organized in a clear hierarchy to maintain project knowledge
- **Documentation Scope**: Focus on both technical implementation details and higher-level product/project context
- **Documentation Maintenance**: Regular updates to keep documentation in sync with implementation

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- **Code Organization**: Modular structure with clear separation of concerns
- **Interface Design**: Clear interfaces for agents, environments, and other components
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling and reporting throughout the system
- **Testing**: Appropriate test coverage for critical components
- **Configuration**: Environment-based configuration with sensible defaults

## Learnings and Project Insights
- The integration of LLMs with trading systems creates a powerful tool for democratizing algorithmic trading
- Natural language interfaces can significantly reduce the barrier to entry for algorithmic trading
- Careful consideration of risk management is essential for any trading system
- The modular architecture facilitates extension and maintenance
