# Active Context: Trading-AI

## Current Focus
The current focus is on creating a comprehensive technical specification document for the Trading-AI project. This document will serve as a blueprint for the project's implementation, providing detailed design information and ensuring alignment between requirements and code.

## Current Mode
**Act Mode** - Executing the task of creating a technical specification document.

## Technical Documentation Requirements
The technical specification document (tech_spec.md) must include:
1. **需求描述** (Requirements Description)
   - Project background and core needs
   - Project goals and scope

2. **需求分析** (Requirements Analysis)
   - Role analysis: User roles and system roles
   - Use case analysis: Core use cases and auxiliary use cases

3. **概要设计** (Conceptual Design)
   - Architecture diagram using Mermaid
   - Domain class diagram using Mermaid
   - Module diagram using Mermaid
   - Database design (if applicable)
   - Key technical challenges

4. **详细设计** (Detailed Design)
   - Module-by-module explanation of interfaces and core business logic
   - UML diagrams for interfaces using Mermaid
   - Sequence diagrams for core business logic using Mermaid
   - Textual descriptions accompanying all diagrams

5. **测试用例** (Test Cases)
   - Testing strategy and approach
   - Key test scenarios

All diagrams must be created using Mermaid syntax, and each section should be concise and clear.

## Recent Changes
- Created initial Memory Bank structure with core documentation files
- Established documentation hierarchy and relationships between files
- Documented primary system architecture and design patterns
- Shifted to creating technical specification document (tech_spec.md)
- Added detailed requirements for the technical specification document
- Simplified system architecture diagram to better reflect the event-driven nature of the system
- Rewrote the conceptual design section of the technical specification
- Replaced the Domain Class Diagram with a more abstract Domain Model in `tech_spec.md`
- Added detailed explanations for the Domain Model and Module Diagram in `tech_spec.md`
- Updated `systemPatterns.md` to align Strategy Execution Flow with the new Domain Model
- Added initial detailed design for "Trading Reflection and Memory" feature in `tech_spec.md`.
- **Revised the "Trading Reflection and Memory" feature design in `tech_spec.md` to correctly place core orchestration logic in `pkg/jarvis.go` based on review feedback.**

## Next Steps
1.  **Implement Trading Reflection and Memory Feature**: Start implementing the feature based on the revised detailed design in `tech_spec.md`, focusing on changes in `pkg/jarvis.go`, `pkg/env/exchange/exchange_entity.go`, `pkg/types/event.go`, and necessary adjustments in `pkg/agents/trading/trading_agent.go`.
2.  Complete the remaining detailed design sections of the technical specification (if any).
3.  Develop test cases section in the technical specification.
4.  Review existing implementation against updated system architecture.
5.  Identify any implementation adjustments needed based on new design.
6.  Finalize the technical specification document.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **Documentation Approach**: Using structured Markdown files organized in a clear hierarchy to maintain project knowledge.
- **Documentation Scope**: Focus on both technical implementation details and higher-level product/project context.
- **Documentation Maintenance**: Regular updates to keep documentation in sync with implementation.
- **Memory Feature Implementation**: The core logic for reflection and memory management will reside in `pkg/jarvis.go` to maintain central control, interacting with the `Trading Agent` as needed for context or decision execution.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- **Code Organization**: Modular structure with clear separation of concerns
- **Interface Design**: Clear interfaces for agents, environments, and other components
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling and reporting throughout the system
- **Testing**: Appropriate test coverage for critical components
- **Configuration**: Environment-based configuration with sensible defaults

## Learnings and Project Insights
- The integration of LLMs with trading systems creates a powerful tool for democratizing algorithmic trading
- Natural language interfaces can significantly reduce the barrier to entry for algorithmic trading
- Careful consideration of risk management is essential for any trading system
- The modular architecture facilitates extension and maintenance
